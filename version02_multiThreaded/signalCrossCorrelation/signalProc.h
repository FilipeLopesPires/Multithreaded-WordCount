/**
 *  \file textProc.h (interface file)
 *
 *  \brief Program that reads in succession several text files and prints a
 * listing of the occurring frequency of word lengths and the number of vowels
 * in each word for each of the supplied texts.
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which
 * enables the creation of a monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Data transfer region implemented as a monitor.
 *
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the workers:
 *     \li getTextChunk
 *     \li savePartialResults
 *     \li presentFilenames
 *     \li printResults.
