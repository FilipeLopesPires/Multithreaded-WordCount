 *
 *  \brief Word Count Problem Monitor methods definition.
 *
 *  The program 'wordCount' deploys worker threads that read in succession several text files text#.txt and calculate the occurring frequency of word lengths and the number of vowels in each word for each of the supplied texts, in the end the program prints the results achieved by its workers.
 *  Threads synchronization is based on monitors. Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the workers:
 *     \li getTextChunk
 *     \li savePartialResults
 *     \li presentFilenames
 *     \li printResults.
