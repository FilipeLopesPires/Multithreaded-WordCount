/**
 *  \file wordCount.c (implementation file)
 *
 *  \brief Program that reads in succession several text files and prints a listing of the occurring 
 *  frequency of word lengths and the number of vowels in each word for each of the supplied texts.
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Generator thread of the intervening entities.
