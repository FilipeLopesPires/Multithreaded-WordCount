 *
 *  \brief Cross Correlation Problem Monitor methods definition.
 *
 *  The program 'signalCrossCorrelation' deploys worker threads that read in
 * succession the values of pairs of signals stored in several data files whose
 * names are provided, compute the circular cross-correlation of each pair and
 * append it to the corresponding file. Threads synchronization is based on
 * monitors. Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread
 * library which enables the creation of a monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the workers:
 *     \li getSignalAndTau
 *     \li savePartialResults
 *     \li presentFilenames
 *     \li writeOrPrintResults.
