# Multithreaded-WordCount
A Parallel Word and Vowel Counter

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a fast computation program that reads in succession several text files and prints a listing of the occurring frequency of word lengths and the number of vowels in each word for each of the supplied
texts.
The source code contains three different implementations: one single-threaded, one multi-threaded and one resorting to the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

Notes: the project's dimension had to be reduced due to Covid-19 related constraints.

The execution times for the multithreaded version using a regular pc are:

For the MPI version, the times are:

## Repository Structure:

/dataset - contains the text files to be processed

/diagrams - contains visual representations of the program for analysis purposes

/src - contains the source code of all versions of the program

## Authors
